# DeepEarTraining Training Lab

A Deep Learning Based Tool for Ear Training

## Project Objective

The main objective of the project is to generate melodic dictation exercises, the Nottingham Dataset has been used used for the training as it provides songs in the form of leadsheets (chords and melody).

## Training the model

- The model used for the training stage is a copy of the repository [**nanoGPT**](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) made by Andrej Karpathy

- The data is feed into the model the same way as the Shakespeare Dataset as seen in the description of the nanoGPT repository.

The outcome and the methodology followed for the experimentation phase is detailed in the report that can be found inside the corresponding folder in this repository.
